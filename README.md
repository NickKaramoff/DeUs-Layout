An English keyboard layout for German residents.

## The Reason

When I came to Germany as a guest in 2014, I noticed, how bad the German
keyboard layout is. When I came here as a semi-permanent resident, I realized,
how awful it is.

For me, a person, who has been using the English QWERTY keyboard the whole time,
this was a nightmare:

- Y and Z are swapped (which is the only useful concept)
- dash and underscore are swapped with slash and question mark
- slash, by the way, is on Shift-7
- parentheses are nudged one key to the left and now are at Shift-8 and Shift-9
  (just why???)
- colon and semicolon are on Shift-dot and Shift-comma. Where are the less-than
  and greater-than signs? Why, where backtick and tilde used to be! Tilde is at
  Option-N, and backtick is gone

And the list goes on; it seems, that every symbol that isn't basic punctuation
was moved somewhere. As a programmer, I can't find this usable.

"Well, use the English keyboard then" I said to myself, but it wasn't good
either. Typing umlauts requires a double keystroke (Option-U A for ä and
Option-U Shift-A for Ä). The Euro sign is also placed weirdly at Shift-Option-2.
